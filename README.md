Welcome to the "**Need for Speed Terminal Race**" game!

This is a simple ASCII car racing game created by myself while learning Python Basics at Software Development Academy.

**In order to run the game:**
1) Python 3 has to be installed
2) Colorama has to be installed (run command "pip install colorama")
3) Run file "car_game.py"

**The game has three functions:**
1) **Start Game** - two predefined cars will race each-other on two separate track lanes and the one first to
reach the end will win. User will also have a choice to have another race. Track lane length is random on each race and
so is the speed of the cars.
2) **View Score-Board** - the results of each race (time and winner name) will be stored until you quit the game. You 
can see the score-board, when you select "See score-board" in the main menu".
3) **Quit** - when you quit the game, the score-board will also be cleared.
